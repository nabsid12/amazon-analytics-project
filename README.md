# **Advanced Amazon Product Sales Analysis Project**

---

## **Project Overview**

This project involves analyzing a dataset of over **20,000 sales records** from an Amazon-like e-commerce platform to uncover insights into customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends. Using PostgreSQL, I performed in-depth querying to address key business challenges such as **revenue analysis, customer segmentation, and inventory management**.

A significant portion of the project focused on data preparation, including cleaning the dataset, handling null values, and ensuring data quality. These steps were critical for deriving accurate and actionable insights.

To enhance understanding, an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is included, providing a clear visualization of the database schema and the relationships between tables.

---

## **Database Setup & Design**

## **Task: Data Cleaning**

I cleaned the dataset by:
- **Removing duplicates**: Duplicates in the customer and order tables were identified and removed.
- **Handling missing values**: Null values in critical fields (e.g., customer address, payment status) were either filled with default values or handled using appropriate methods.

---

## **Handling Null Values**

Null values were handled based on their context:
- **Customer addresses**: Missing addresses were assigned default placeholder values.
- **Payment statuses**: Orders with null payment statuses were categorized as “Pending.”
- **Shipping information**: Null return dates were left as is, as not all shipments are returned.

---

## **Objective**

The primary objective of this project is to showcase SQL proficiency through complex queries that address real-world e-commerce business challenges. The analysis covers various aspects of e-commerce operations, including:
- Customer behavior
- Sales trends
- Inventory management
- Payment and shipping analysis
- Forecasting and product performance
  

## **Identifying Business Problems**

Key business problems identified:
1. Low product availability due to inconsistent restocking.
2. High return rates for specific product categories.
3. Significant delays in shipments and inconsistencies in delivery times.
4. High customer acquisition costs with a low customer retention rate.

## **Solving Business Problems**

### Solutions Implemented:
